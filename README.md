- check split ahead of time in tgi-interface-onsen2-panels.source.js and create or don't create the <div class="right">
- for both left and right menu if only one command then don't make menu just set command and use its icon
- think about way to override the icon if menu

- indent is ignored maybe that is fine?
- add icons where it fits
- create interface focus attribute like read / write one that will do a push of the menu with back button
- render buttons with 3 cols or if indented 2 cols
- option for bottom menu style
